1.The area of a cyclic quadrilateral is the maximum possible for any quadrilateral with the given side lengths.
Area = sqrt[(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)]
2. Eulers Totient function phi(n) = n *(1-1/p1) *(1-1/p2) .......
where p1 and p2 are prime factors of n
3. A number can be represented as sum of two perfect squares if in the prime factorization,the primes of the form(4k+3) should occur even number of times.
